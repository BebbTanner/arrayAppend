/*Initially I wanted to create a program that allows the user to add and remove values from an array.
After looking into it, it would seem that I cannot do that. So, instead I will be using a vector to that 
instead.

TODO:
	Initialize a vector
	Ask the user to input the values in the vector
	Create a do-while loop that will allow users to finish inputing values
	Add something that will allow users to remove items from the vector
	Add a for-loop to print out the values stored in the vector
